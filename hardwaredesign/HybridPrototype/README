The Hybrid Residential Prototype is meant to solve the power usage problems presented by the original Residential Prototype. 
This is accomplished by using a low-powered AVR microcontroller, the ATtiny84, to count pulses from a Hall Effect sensor. The Raspberry Pi
embedded computer will be disconnected from power until turned on by the ATtiny84, at which time the Raspberry Pi will read data collected
by the Raspberry Pi. When the Raspberry Pi is finished, it shuts down and power is again disconnected by the ATtiny84.

An electronic hardware schematic is provided, showing the ATtiny84 system connected to a Raspberry Pi. C code is provided for the ATtiny84
microcontroller, and Python scripts are provided for the Raspberry Pi computer.
